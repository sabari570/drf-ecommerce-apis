INORDER TO MAINTAIN A PROFESSIONAL CODE AND WELL STRUCTURED PROJECT:
	* Divide the settings configuration into 3 files:
		* base.py -> that contains all the base configuration
		* development.py -> that takes in the base.py and then additionally adds anything that is needed for the dev server
		* production.py -> that takes in the base.py and then additionally adds anything that is needed for the prod server

	* After that we need to set the environment variable to select which if this conf should we choose:
		IN LINUX:
		* export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myproject.settings.local  # For local development
		* export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myproject.settings.production  # For production

		IN WINDOWS:
		* set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myproject.settings.local  # For local development
		* set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myproject.settings.production  # For production

	* After that update the manage.py and wsgi.py files accordingly:
		* First set a variable in the env file: 
			DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.base
			Choose which is the conf is it base or dev or prod
		* Next inside the manage.py file change the line:
			os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", config("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"))
	
	* The wsgi.py file configurations are for production purpose only.
